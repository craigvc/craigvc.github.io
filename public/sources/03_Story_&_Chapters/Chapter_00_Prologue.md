# 🪞 Chapter 0: Prologue – Echoes Before the Rift

_The sun struggled to pierce the perpetual haze over Junkyard Town, casting a dim, rust-colored glow on the expanse of twisted metal and forgotten relics. Once a thriving industrial hub, now it lay as a testament to a world undone, where scavengers like Alex Mercer eked out a living amidst the debris._

Alex wiped the sweat from his brow, smearing a streak of grime across his forehead. He'd been at it since dawn, sifting through the detritus in hopes of finding something—anything—worth trading at the Scrap Markets. His latest endeavor involved the gutted remains of a magitech vehicle, its once sleek design now a corroded skeleton.

“Come on, you old rust bucket,” Alex muttered, yanking at a particularly stubborn panel. With a screech, it gave way, revealing the tangled innards of the machine. Amidst the corroded circuits and frayed wires, something caught his eye—a faint, otherworldly glow.

Nestled within the wreckage was a small core, its surface etched with intricate runes that pulsed with a soft blue light. Unlike the surrounding decay, it appeared untouched by time.

“Well, aren’t you a pretty little anomaly,” Alex mused, reaching out to grasp the core.

The moment his fingers made contact, the core thrummed to life. A surge of energy rippled outward, and the world around him shifted.

After **kicking aside a half-melted drone**, Alex uncovers something unusual—a **small, rune-etched core**, wedged between the remains of an ancient vehicle’s engine. Unlike everything else in the junkyard, it looks… untouched. Almost **pristine**.

### **The Artifact Discovery**

After kicking aside a half-melted drone, Alex uncovered something unusual—a small, rune-etched core wedged between the remains of an ancient vehicle’s engine. Unlike everything else in the junkyard, it looked… untouched. Almost **pristine**.

Naturally, he poked it.

The core hummed.

Then it **flares to life**, sending a ripple of **uncontrolled magic through the junkyard**. Metal debris **floats into the air, car doors snap open and shut on their own, and a nearby vending machine begins dispensing expired soup at an alarming rate.**
