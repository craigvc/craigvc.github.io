# ⏱️ Time Mechanics Tech – *Bleak Horizons*

This system handles the time loop structure, echo memory, and causality-breaking puzzles.

---

## 🔁 Time Loop Triggering

- Triggered via:
  - Rift Overload
  - Player death under loop conditions
  - Major quest event (e.g., breaking a paradox seal)

---

## 🧠 Memory System

### Anchored Items:
- Items or data marked as “Anchored” persist through loops
- Managed via tags + custom SaveGame data

### Loop-Aware Dialogue:
- NPCs gain memory flags
- Dialogue branches reflect knowledge of previous loops

---

## 📦 Blueprint System

- `LoopManager` BP handles reset state, delay triggers, and feedback FX
- Timeline node to reverse screen shader
- Valtorin reacts dynamically

---

## 🎮 Puzzle Use

- Time loop triggers re-open locked paths
- Echo of player may appear (previous version)
- Rewards: spells, narrative paths, alternate endings

> The world remembers — even if most of it pretends not to.
