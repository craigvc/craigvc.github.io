# 🔮 Rift Realm Design – *Bleak Horizons*

The Rift is a semi-conscious dimensional tear that bleeds magic into the Wasteland.

## 🌪️ Entry Points
- Triggered by:
  - Rift Artifacts
  - Loop anomalies
  - Chapter story events
- Entered via warp cutscenes or sudden gameplay rips

## 🧙 Zone Types
- [[Swamp of Poor Life Choices]] – magical swamp full of talking flora, traps, and puzzle ruins
- [[Haunted Rift City]] – ghosts reliving their deaths, time distortions
- [[Fantasy Kingdom]] – a surreal and pristine world of castles, nobles, and dark secrets

## 🧩 Gameplay Logic
- Rift Realms are loaded as separate Levels
- All use alternate HUDs, glitch filters, or shifting UI effects
- Some puzzles require info/items from the Wasteland to solve

> Each realm has a tone shift. Humor, horror, or high fantasy – filtered through chaos.
