# 🧱 Level Instances – *Bleak Horizons*

Reusable modular environments loaded via Blueprint at runtime. Not Sublevels.

## 🏙️ Urban/Wasteland Zones

- `LI_RustTown`
- `LI_GasStation_Outpost`
- `LI_Scrapyard_A`
- `LI_MissouriRuins`

## 🧟 Rift & Fantasy Biomes

- `LI_GraveyardCrypt`
- `LI_FantasyMarket`
- `LI_SwampRuins`
- `LI_CastleCourtyard`
- `LI_CursedLibrary`

## 🧪 Design Tips

- Each Level Instance contains its own navmesh, RVT support, and transition zone
- Terrain is sculpted around the instance, then masked with rocks, rubble, RVT blends, and decals
