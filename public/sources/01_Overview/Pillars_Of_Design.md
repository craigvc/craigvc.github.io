# 🧱 Pillars of Design – *Bleak Horizons*

These are the foundational principles that guide all design decisions across gameplay, story, visuals, and tone. If a system or feature doesn’t support these—it doesn’t belong.

---

## 🎭 1. [[Absurdist Survival]]

The world is brutal, broken, and strange—but there’s wit and weirdness in every corner. Embrace the unexpected.

> “You might die in a radioactive swamp, but at least the mushroom that kills you will insult your shoes.”

---

## 🌀 2. [[Time Loop Mechanics]]

- Time loops, paradox locks, and [[Reality Glitches]]
- Solving past mistakes can change the future
- Not everything resets the same way

> “You don’t manipulate time. It plays with *you*.”

---

## 🧙 3. [[Magic]] Meets Scrap Metal

- Guns and spells
- Enchanted vending machines
- Talking relics like [[Valtorin]]
- Sorcerers riding rusted elevators

> “You’ll cast fireball with one hand and hotwire a turret with the other.”

---

## 🧠 4. Player Choice > Designer Control

- [[Dialogue Choices]] matter
- [[Faction Reputation System]]
- Morality is flexible, weird, and sometimes explosive

> “If you piss off the wrong ghost, expect it to follow you… narrating your bad decisions.”

---

## 🌍 5. Modular World, Fluid Structure

- Built in [[Unreal Engine 5.5+]] with [[World Partition]] and [[Level Instances]]
- No sublevels, no traditional streaming volumes
- [[Data Layers]] toggle story states

---

## 🎬 6. Narrative Through Absurdity

- Magical realism in a wasteland  
- Deadpan humor with mythic undertones  
- [[Recurring NPCs]] that feel like chaotic forces of nature

> If it’s not a little weird, a little broken, and a little brilliant—it’s not *Bleak Horizons.*
