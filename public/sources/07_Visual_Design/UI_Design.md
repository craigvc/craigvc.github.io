# 🖥️ UI Design – *Bleak Horizons*

The UI should reflect the world: fractured, glitching, and deeply tied to the player’s interaction with [[Valtorin]] and the [[Rift]].

---

## 🎛 Core Principles

- **Diegetic where possible** (e.g. watch face for navigation)
- **Glitch aesthetics** used for time/magic distortions
- **Minimalist design** focused on legibility in dusty, cluttered environments

## 🎯 HUD Elements

| Element        | Function                         |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Health & Stamina | Lower-left radial arcs            |
| Rift Energy     | Glowing meter tied to Valtorin    |
| Watch Face      | Embedded minimap + quest pulses   |
| Loot Highlight  | Subtle outline & sound pulse      |
| Notification     | Diegetic messages from Valtorin  |

> “Your UI shouldn’t feel like a screen. It should feel like a malfunctioning, ancient system built into your wrist.”

## 📟 Interaction Cues

- “Interact” prompts are contextual — salvage, climb, or inspect
- Animated overlays pulse with energy during Rift zones
- Decisions display as spoken thoughts or internal conflict (like [[Disco Elysium]])

---

## 🌀 Magic/Time Effects

- Time slows → UI distorts, warps inward
- Rift spells → pulse VFX ripple across screen edges
- Death loops → flashbacks flicker UI frames
