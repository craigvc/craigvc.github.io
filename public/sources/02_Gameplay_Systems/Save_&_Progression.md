# 💾 Save & Progression – *Bleak Horizons*

Saving, dying, and coming back weird — it's all part of the journey.

---

## 📍 Save System

Players can save at specific in-world locations. There is **no quicksave** — only intentional rest points.

### ✅ Save Locations:
- [[Campsites]]
- [[Gas Stations & Garages]]
- [[Rustown]] (Safehouse / Inn / Maggie’s Motel)
- [[Outposts]] or small bunkers
- [[Valtorin]]'s personal checkpoint (one per chapter)

### 🔐 Save Mechanics:
- Manual save only at valid points
- Can rest to recover [[Stamina]], [[Health]], and Rift energy
- Some save points include fast travel once unlocked

> “Want to save your game? Light a fire and hope it doesn’t attract scavengers.”
