# ⏳ Time Loop Mechanics – *Bleak Horizons*

Time is not linear. It’s fractured, fluid, and occasionally sarcastic.

---

## 🌀 Core Concept

The world is caught in a subtle **time loop cycle** triggered by the Rift and tied to [[Valtorin]].

You won’t always know when the loop starts or ends… but your actions echo.

---

## 🧩 How Time Loops Work

- Triggered by key events, deaths, or decisions
- Loop does **not** always reset the entire world
- NPCs may remember things they shouldn’t
- Items or knowledge can persist between loops
- Valtorin comments on "déjà vu moments"

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Uses

### 🔐 Puzzle Solving
- Go back and **change outcomes**
- Lock/unlock doors with future info
- Influence past events using Rift glitches

### ⏱️ Combat Advantages
- Use [[Temporal Magic]] to:
  - Reverse damage
  - Clone yourself from a past loop
  - Slow enemies caught in time bubbles

### 📜 Narrative Layers
- Characters may shift behavior across loops
- Some [[Side Quests]] only unlock after seeing both sides
- Moral choices may appear different in future loops

## 🧠 Loop Variants

| Type         | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Micro Loop   | Short resets, mostly puzzle-focused |
| Macro Loop   | Story-based resets, major world consequences |
| Soft Loop    | Time repeats subtly — only parts of the world change |
| Hard Loop    | Full chapter reset — used rarely, dramatically |

---

## 🧠 Loop Memory System

- Certain items tagged as "Anchored" will persist
- [[Valtorin]] may “record” knowledge between loops
- Loop knowledge influences:
  - Dialogue
  - Faction choices
  - Puzzle outcomes
  - Ending options

---

## 🧬 World Reactions

- Some NPCs react strangely to repeat actions
- Certain factions may develop **loop awareness**
- Echoes of past versions of Alex may appear as enemies, guides, or hallucinations

---

## 🔓 Final Puzzle

To unlock [[Valtorin’s True Form]], the player must:
- Break a paradox lock
- Use looped versions of themselves
- Solve a time-loop puzzle only possible with knowledge from multiple timelines
